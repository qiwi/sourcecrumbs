> Make npm provenance attestation a bit more code bound

## Concept
> [The provenance attestation](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements) is established by publicly providing a link to a package's source code and build instructions from the build environment. This allows developers to verify where and how your package was built before they download it.

_This allows_, so let's try to implement a working draft. Suppose we have published a package with [sourcemaps](https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html) and provenance telemetry in its [packument](https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/master/docs/responses/package-metadata.md).
We could try:
* compare file by file pkg inners with the bound repo commit.
* match sourcemap data with the referenced git hosted sources via [sourcemap-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sourcemap-validator).
* verify that pkg target (bundle, dist, whatever) corresponds its sources somehow. Hmm... This may require heuristics, unminification, AST comparison or something like that.

## Usage

```ts
import {track} from '@qiwi/sourcecrumbs'

const result = await track({
  name: 'toposource',
  version: '1.1.4',
  registry: 'https://registry.npmjs.org'
})
// â†’
{
  'package.json': {
    source: {
    sources: [
      'package.json'
    ],
      coherence: 0.9995309568480301
    },
    sourcemap: null
  },
  'target/cjs/index.js': {
    source: null,
    sourcemap: {
      sources: [
        'src/main/ts/index.ts',
        'src/main/ts/toposource.ts'
      ],
      valid: true,
      coherence: null
    }
  },
  ...
}
```
